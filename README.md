In a Plants vs Zombies game, someone knows there is an 8 tile area in which 3 zombies will spawn. 
They seperate this area into three rectangular areas and colour them in.

A red rectangle covers 4 tiles.
An orange and yellow rectangle each cover tiles.
Three zombies will each spawn in the area on 3 different tiles.

Find the probabilities of three conditions:

i. One zombie spawns on orange, one spawns on yellow, and one spawns on any colour.
ii. At least one zombie spawns on either yellow or orange but not both, and the remaining zombies spawn on red.
iii. All three spawn on the red area.
